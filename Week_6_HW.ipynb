        "2. What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?\n",
        "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's original distribution.\n",

        "Blinding: Use single or double-blind methods to prevent expectations from influencing outcomes.\n",
        "Standardization: Ensure consistent data collection and measurement procedures.\n",
        "Control Groups: Include groups that do not receive treatment to serve as a baseline.\n",
        "Data Cleaning: Identify and remove outliers or errors.\n",
        "Awareness of Cognitive Biases: Be vigilant against confirmation bias, selection bias, or survivorship bias during analysis.\n",
        "5. What are confounding variables?\n",
        "Confounding variables are extraneous factors that can distort the apparent relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In a study linking exercise (independent variable) to weight loss (dependent variable), diet could be a confounding variable if not controlled.\n",
        "Effects: They can lead to false associations or obscure true relationships.\n",
